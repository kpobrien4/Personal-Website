        <p class="thin">Hello treasured reader! My name is Kevin and I'm a software engineer, physicist, and musician from upstate New York. I graduated from the University at Buffalo in May of 2019 with a degree in Physics, and immediately attended Flatiron School, an immersive five month coding school in the field of software development. I have since been working on a bunch of software projects, one of which is this very website! My goal is to create software, or work for a company that creates software with the aim of helping people. I hope to be an inspiring and creative developer, who is always striving to learn and teach others. My current short term goals are to complete the courses I am enrolled in in Python and Linux</p>

        <p class="thin">My first introduction to coding came in around 2016, right after graduating from high school, with a video called "What Most Schools Don't Teach" which featured the likes of tech household names such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey, and those less known for their coding exploits like Will.I.Am talking about their experiences with computer programming. Though I did not rush to coding immediately after watching the video, I downloaded a couple of tutorials, and kept the idea of learning to coding in the back of my mind. After finishing my degree in Physics, I opted to change my route and enroll in Flatiron School, as the versatility and creativity I had seen in software development was incredibly appealing to me.
